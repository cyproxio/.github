# Cyprox · AI-Driven Security for Modern Systems

Welcome to the official GitHub organization of **Cyprox**, where we build open, intelligent, and extensible tools to redefine security — powered by AI.

---

## 🧠 Our Mission

Security tools generate noise.  
We build systems that **think**, **decide**, and **act** — like a security expert would.

Cyprox enables **agentic AI-based security automation**, giving both individuals and teams the power to run, reason over, and orchestrate industry-standard tools in smarter ways.

## 🔍 What We Build

At Cyprox, we develop a wide range of components that support AI-powered security workflows, including:

- 🔄 **MCP (Model-Context-Protocol) Servers**: Standardized interfaces to drive open-source security tools using structured reasoning.
- 📦 **Security Tool Wrappers**: Intelligent adapters for tools like Nmap, Scout Suite, and more.
- 🧩 **Burp Suite Extension – API Exporter**: Converts intercepted HTTP traffic into OpenAPI/Postman docs to help AI agents understand and analyze web application behavior.
- 🖥️ **Web + Desktop Platform (Coming Soon)**: Our full-featured security platform for orchestrating AI-driven assessments across your stack.
